# CBook Solutions

C solutions for the exercises in "The C Programming Language" (Kernighan & Ritchie).

## Overview

These are solutions to some problems from The C Programming Language Book. The goal is to practice
C programming fundementals, memory management, algorithms & trying to make myself feel smarter than i actually am.
## Prerequisites

- GCC or any C compiler supporting C99 or later

## Usage

To compile and run a specific exercise manually:
```bash
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o ex1-14 ex1-14.c
./ex1-14 < input.txt
```
Replace `ex1-14.c` and `ex1-14` with the desired exercise filename (format: `ex<chapter>-<exercise>.c`).
