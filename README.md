C programming fundementals, memory management, algorithms & trying to make myself feel smarter than i actually am.

## Prerequisites

- GCC or any C compiler supporting C99 or later & CMake

## Usage

To compile and run a specific exercise manually:

```
Replace `4-X/` and `4-14.c` with the desired exercise filename (format: `chapter-X/<exercise>.c`).
